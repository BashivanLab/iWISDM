# iWISDM
iWISDM, short for the instructed-Virtual VISual Decision Making, is a virtual environment that is capable of generate a limitless array of vision-language tasks of varying complexity. iWISDM builds on the compositional nature of natural behavior and the fact that complex tasks are often compositionally constructed by combining smaller task units together in time. We thus developed a framework which allows instantiating visual decision making tasks as computational graphs that could be combined together in different ways to construct virtually infinite number of tasks with varying complexity. It also allows for procedural generation of natural language instructions parallel to tasks.
 Below is an example of the generated tasks and the accompanying task graphs: 
### AS a reminder to add examples
iWISDM inherits several classes from COG (https://github.com/google/cog) to build task graphs. For convenience, we have pre-implemented several commonly used cognitive tasks in task_bank.py. For usage instructions, please refer to â€¦ 

Additionally, For convenience, we have pre-generated four benchmarks of increased complexity level for evaluation of large multi-modal models.

### Basic Usage
```python

from wisdom import make
from wisdom import read_write

# environment initialization
with open('../benchmarking/configs/high_complexity_all.json', 'r') as f:
    config = json.load(f)  # using pre-defined AutoTask configuration
env = make(env_id='ShapeNet')
env.set_env_spec(
    env.init_env_spec(
        auto_gen_config=config,
    )
)

# AutoTask procedural task generation and saving trial
tasks = env.generate_tasks(10)  # generate 10 random task graphs and tasks
_, (_, temporal_task) = tasks[0]
trials = env.generate_trials(tasks=[temporal_task])  # generate a trial
imgs, _, info_dict = trials[0]
read_write.write_trial(imgs, info_dict, f'output/trial_{i}')
```
